# Change Log

# v0.6.8

* Support for overriding global MSBuild properties before a project is loaded (tintoy/msbuild-project-tools-vscode#166).

# v0.6.6

* Correctly handle VSCode/LSP completion behaviour where the last character typed is implicitly part of the current selection, if it triggered completion (tintoy/msbuild-project-tools-vscode#93).

# v0.6.5

* Extension now more aggressively forces local user runtime and picks up the latest runtime version available (including previews). This makes it possible to use the extension with preview versions of .NET/MSBuild (tintoy/msbuild-project-tools-vscode#152).
* Language server now validates `dotnet` host process exit code and can provide more diagnostic information in some scenarios, such as when the SDK configured in `global.json` is not available (tintoy/msbuild-project-tools-server#106).

# v0.6.4

* Update intellisense help content for Content items and CopyToXXXDirectory global item metadata (tintoy/msbuild-project-tools-vscode#148).

# v0.6.3

* Improve handling of concurrent loads for MSBuild sub-projects (fixes tintoy/msbuild-project-tools-server#100).

# v0.6.0

* Extension startup time has been improved.
* The MSBuild language server now runs on .NET 8.
* Isolated runtime for the language server is back, so users no longer need to have a specific version of .NET to be installed to be able to use the extension.

# v0.5.3

* Improve file-access behaviour for project.assets.json (tintoy/msbuild-project-tools-server#82).

# v0.5.2

* Revert usage of the `vscode-dotnet-runtime` extension (tintoy/msbuild-project-tools-vscode#89 - isolated runtimes are problematic if you want to use global SDKs).

# v0.5.1

* Temporary roll-back from v0.5.0 to v0.4.5 (tintoy/msbuild-project-tools-vscode#137). 

# v0.5.0

* The .NET runtime, required to run the language server, is now acquired using the `vscode-dotnet-runtime` extension as a dependency (so you don't need to have that specific version of .NET on your machine installed to use the extension)
* All completion are now shown by default
* Basic integration with `redhat.vscode-xml` extension is now provided, so you can use its features for `msbuild` language
* Language server, packed with the extension, is now built in release mode
* Extension bundle size has been significantly optimized
* Dependencies have been updaded to address known security vulnerabilities

# v0.4.9

* Wait for redirected STDOUT/STDERR streams to complete when launching dotnet host process (tintoy/msbuild-project-tools-vscode#105, tintoy/msbuild-project-tools-server#28).  
  Thanks, @tillig!

* Mark extension as a workspace extension to enable correct behaviour in remote scenarios (tintoy/msbuild-project-tools-vscode#99).

# 0.4.3

* Fix ArgumentNullException from NuGet client library when requesting package version completions (tintoy/msbuild-project-tools-vscode#91).

# 0.4.0

* Support for manually ignoring configured package sources using the `msbuildProjectTools.nuget.ignorePackageSources` extension setting (tintoy/msbuild-project-tools-server#24).

## v0.2.20

* Log errors encountered while warming up NuGet client as Verbose instead of Error (tintoy/msbuild-project-tools-server#2).

## v0.2.19

* Improve completion behaviour.
* Improve performance of element and attribute completions for tasks in `Target` elements.

## v0.2.13

* Bug-fix: attribute completions are erroneously offered when creating a new element under an `ItemGroup` element (tintoy/msbuild-project-tools-vscode#21).

## v0.2.12

* Simplify extension / language-service configuration schema.  
  The extension will automatically upgrade settings in the legacy format (i.e. ones without `'schemaVersion': 1`), but now ignores the old `msbuildProjectFileTools` configuration section.
* Bug-fix: completions for item metadata expressions being offered when only completions for item group expressions should be offered.
* Bug-fix: `NullReferenceException` when listing completions for item group expressions.
* Bug-fix: restore missing hover tooltip for SDK-style project import.

## v0.2.9

* Add command (`NuGet: toggle pre-release`) to toggle NuGet pre-release packages and package versions on / off (tintoy/msbuild-project-tools-vscode#18).

* _Experimental:_ Add completions for task elements based on task types declared in the project.
* _Experimental:_ Add completions for task attributes based on task types declared in the project.
* More testing on MacOS and Linux.
* _Experimental:_ Parsing of MSBuild item transform expressions.
* _Experimental:_ Add experimental feature flag (`empty-completion-lists`) to enable returning empty completion lists rather than null  
  Fixes tintoy/msbuild-project-tools-vscode#17.  
  We can't do this by default because our extension depends on VSCode's behaviour when null is returned vs an empty completion list (when null is returned, no completion list is displayed; when an empty completion list is returned, purely-textual completions are displayed based on current file contents).  
  This behaviour is mainly to support clients other than VSCode (e.g. aCute).

## v0.2.7

* Add setting to control which types of objects from the current projects are included when offering completions.
* _Experimental:_ Add completions for qualified and unqualified item metadata expressions (`%(XXX.YYY)` and `%(YYY)`).

## v0.2.6

* Bug-fix: attribute completions should be available on elements that don't currently have any attributes.
* Bug-fix: go-to-definition should also work for regular-style project imports (not just SDK-style imports).
* _Experimental:_ Add completions for MSBuild property and item expressions (`$(XXX)` and `@(XXX)`).

## v0.2.4

* Bug-fix: missing completions for top-level elements (e.g. `<PropertyGroup>`, `<ItemGroup>`, `<Target>`).
* Improve help for well-known items and their metadata.
* Bug-fix for tintoy/msbuild-project-tools-vscode#11 (should not fail on non-standard file extension).

## v0.2.3

* Add help for well-known elements, attributes, properties, and item types from `MSBuild.*.xsd` to improve completions and tooltips-on-hover.
* Improve completions for attributes that refer to target names.

## v0.2.2

* Add completions for attributes that refer to target names.

## v0.2.1

* Add completions for top-level elements (e.g. `<PropertyGroup>`, `<ItemGroup>`, `<Target>`).
* Add completions for property elements (both common and locally-defined).
* Improve language-service internals (more consistently accurate comprehension of project contents).

## v0.2.0

* Improved completions:
  * Add completions for `PackageReference` and `DotNetCliToolReference`.
  * Add completions for common item attributes.
  * Add completions for property `Condition` elements.
  * Support for logging to [Seq](https://getseq.net/).  
    Only useful if you're hacking on the language service itself.

## v0.1.12

* Sort package versions in descending order for classic completion provider, too.  
  If you prefer the old behaviour, you can set `msbuildProjectTools.nuget.newestVersionsFirst` to `false`.

## v0.1.11

* Sort package versions in descending order.  
  If you prefer the old behaviour, you can set `msbuildProjectTools.nuget.newestVersionsFirst` to `false`.

## v0.1.10

* Improve tooltip content when hovering on MSBuild XML.
* Enable jumping from PackageReference element to package on NuGet.org.

## v0.1.9

* Add specific hover tooltip for Condition attributes.

## v0.1.8

* Add basic syntax-highlighting for expressions in MSBuild projects (currently only supported in attribute values).
* Improve delay on first completion of PackageReference by asynchronously warming up the NuGet client.

## v0.1.7

* Add configuration setting to disable tooltip-on-hover.
* Add configuration setting to control logging verbosity.

## v0.1.6

* Actually enable the language server by default (sorry about that).

## v0.1.5

* Language server is now enabled by default.
* Improve calculation of line / column offsets.

## v0.1.4

* Provide intellisense for regular-style and SDK-style imports whose conditions evaluate to false.
* Respect the user's nominated version of the .NET Core tooling to use when loading master projects (equivalent to running `dotnet --version` in the solution directory, this respects `global.json` if present).

## v0.1.3

* Provide intellisense for items whose conditions evaluate to `false`.
* Show information about conditions on hover for items and properties.

## v0.1.2

* Handle `Import` elements that give rise to multiple imported projects (this already worked correctly for SDK-style imports).
* Initial support for master and sub projects.

## v0.1.1

* Use a patched version of `Microsoft.Language.Xml` that behaves correctly in non-windows environments (issues with CR vs CRLF line-endings).
* Improve tooltips on hover.

## v0.1.0

* Fix handling of non-windows line endings.

## v0.1.0-rc1

* Fix cross-platform path handling.

## v0.1.0-beta2

* More informative tooltips on hover
* Handle multiple items originating from a single item group element in the XML.
* Improved error handling

## v0.1.0-beta1

* Implement go-to-definition for project-style and SDK-style imports.
* Detect .NET Core version on startup, and fall back to classic completion provider if >= 2.0.0 is not available.

## v0.1.0-alpha2

* Add configuration property (`msbuildProjectFileTools.languageService.enable`) to switch between MSBuild language engine and classic completion provider.

## v0.1.0-alpha1

* The extension now uses a language server based on Microsoft's Language Server Protocol.
* Tooltips for MSBuild objects in the project file.
* Support for any configured (remote) package source.  
  We're using the new NuGet client libraries so it should understand global, solution-local, and project-local package sources.
* Highly-improved handling of project files with broken or invalid XML (thanks to `Microsoft.Language.Xml`).

## v0.0.2

* Resolve the URL for the NuGet v3 AutoComplete API at extension startup.

## v0.0.1

* Initial release.
